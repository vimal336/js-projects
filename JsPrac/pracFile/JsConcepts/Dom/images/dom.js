// DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming interface 
// that allows us to create, change, or remove elements from the document. 

// We can also add events to these elements to make our page more dynamic.

// browser gives DOM API functions like getElemenyById(), createElement() etc..

// and this functions are not from javascript these all are provided by DOM API

// The DOM views an HTML document as a tree of nodes. A node represents an HTML element.

//Dom is not part of the js language but is instead a web api used to build websites.

// dom was designed to be independent of any particular prog lang.
