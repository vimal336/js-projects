// The filter method in JavaScript is designed as a higher-order function that iterates over each element of an array, 
// allowing developers to apply a specific condition to filter out elements.

// The filter method doesn't modify the original array, but instead creates and returns 
// a new array containing only the elements that meet the specified condition.



const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0);
// evenNumbers: [2, 4]


const filternum = numbers.filter((fil))

console.log(filt);
